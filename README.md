This is a flask based RFP management system in Tendors.


In Contruction segment contracting and sub-contracting there are multiple RFP submitted by multiple vendors again any tendor, assessing those RFP in terms of technical, financial, legal and work scope perspective is very time-consuming task for tendor issuing organization. We are looking for GenAI based solution that can generate a summary report for all RFP submitted against tendor in terms of financial efficiency, timeline, legal requirements, qualification criteria, technical parameters and previous track records. 

Proposed system should does the following:
1. Can upload multiple RFP documents against any given tendor document 
2. Tabulaizes the requirements from tendor and categorize them into legal, finance, complaince etc 
3. Reads content from all RFP from multiple vendors highlighting the vaguness of the contractual requirements from corresponding RFP 
4. Generates summary comparasion report prefabally in tabular format 
5. Recommends top 3 vendors with justification who has potential to qualify for contract
